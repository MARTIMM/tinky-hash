=head1 Description

To understand this module it is wise to also read the documentation about
Tinky and day 18 2016 of the perl6 advent calendar.

I was triggered writing C<Tinky::Hash> by the C<Tinky::JSON> module to define a
data structure instead of using the commands directly. It makes for a cleaner
setup all from a single class where it is needed. Also it can be stored in
other formats besides C<JSON>, Examples are C<YAML> and C<TOML>.

A few things are added to this class compared to the C<Tinky::JSON>
implementation. Using a class which inherits the C<Tinky::Hash> class it is
possible to call methods defined by their name in the config. Furthermore,
besides that a method can be called upon all transition events, it is possible
to call a method on one specific transition.

Because of the way this class stores its data, the workflows are still usable
from other classes which inherit the C<Tinky::Hash>. This class has a kind of a
singleton effect because the class uses C<my> instead of C<has> attributes.

=head1 Methods

=head2 new

  submethod BUILD ( Hash :$config )

Instantiate class. When config is given, it will call C<from-hash> with it.

=head2 from-hash

  method from-hash ( Hash:D :$config )

Reads the configuration and uses the methods from Tinky to define states,
transitions, workflow and also defines the taps for the events of transitions,
leaving or entering a state.

=head3 Configuration structure

The top level looks like the following;

  :config( {
      :states( ... ),
      :transitions( ... ),
      :workflow( ... ),
      :taps( ... )
    }
  )

=item1 states

States is used to specify all the states used in the workflow. It is an array
of names for the states. These are used to refer to in transitions, workflow and
taps.

  :config( { :states([<locked opened>]), ... })

=item transitions

Transitions describe the connections between the states. The names of defined
transitions are used in taps. With the states mentioned above;

  :config( {
      ...
      :transitions( {
          :openit( { :from<locked>, :to<opened>}),
          :lockit( { :from<opened>, :to<locked>})
        }
      ),
      ...
    }
  )

=item workflow

A workflow binds everything together specifying a name for the flow and an
initial state. E.g. using the defined config above

  :config( {
      ...
      :workflow( { :name(resource-lock), :initial-state<locked>}),
      ...
    }
  )

=item taps

Supplies are used to handle events such as entering or leaving a state or on
transitions. By creating a tap on a supply the object gets informed by these
events. C<Tinky> allows you to specify two types of taps. These are the taps on
events on entering and leaving a state and a tap to get all transition events.
With C<Tinky::Hash> you can also specify taps on a specific transition. E.g.

  :config( {
      ...
      :taps( {
          :states( {
              :locked( { :leave<make-log>}),
            }
          ),
        }
      )
    }
  )

Here when a transition is made from I<locked> to I<opened>, the method
C<make-log> is called upon leaving the state I<locked>. Methods used like this
must be defined as follows;

  method make-log ( $object, Str :$state, EventType :$event )

Most of the time the C<$object> is the same as the object from the class where
in the method is defined. Since it is possible to switch workflows, even if
they are defined in another class, this object can be the one from the other
class.

C<$state> is the state name and C<$event> is one of C<Enter> or C<Leave>.

In the example the method is called when leaving the state C<:leave<...>>. When
entering the enter method is called. To define this use C<:enter<...>>.

The next example shows the definition of a tap on a specific transition, in this
case I<lockit> which specifies the transition from C<opened>.to C<Locked>.

      ...
      :taps( {
          :transitions( { :lockit<save-key>}),
        }
      )
      ...

The method must be defined as;

  method save-key ( $object, Tinky::Transition $trans, :Str $transit )

C<$object> is the same as above. For more information on C<Tinky::Transition
$trans> look at the Tinky documentation. C<$transit> is the name of the
transition which is I<lockit> here.

The 3rd tap type is the global one which calls the method on all transitions.

      ...
      :taps( {
          :transitions-global<log-trans>,
        }
      )
      ...

Definition of the method should be;

  method log-trans ( $object, Tinky::Transition $trans ) {

Almost the same as the specific transitions but without the transition name.


=head2 workflow

  method workflow ( Str:D $workflow-name )

Set the workflow to start with. The workflow starts with the initial state
defined with the workflow in the configuration. Later when switching to another
workflow the state will not change despite the initial state for that particular
workflow. However, an exception is thrown when the current state does not exist
in the new workflow.

Below the surface it will execute C<apply-workflow> from C<Tinky::Object>.

=head2 go-state

  method go-state ( Str:D $state-name )

Procede to the next state. It wil execute the C<$o.state = $new-state> from
C<Tinky::Object>.
